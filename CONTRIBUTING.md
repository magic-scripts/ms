   msreg checksum scripts/your-script.sh
   
   # Test with Magic Scripts (if applicable)
   ms install yourcommand
   yourcommand --version
   ```

5. **Update Registry (if adding new commands)**

   ```

## Commit Message Format

```

## Testing Requirements

- All scripts must include `--version` and `--help` options
- Checksum calculations must be accurate
- Registry format must be valid
- No breaking changes without major version bump
- Document any new configuration keys

## Release Process (Maintainers)

1. **Prepare Release**
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git checkout -b release/v0.0.2
   # Update versions, documentation, changelog
   ```

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge release/v0.0.2
   git tag v0.0.2
   ```

3. **Create Snapshot**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b release/v0.0.2
   git push origin release/v0.0.2
