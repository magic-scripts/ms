# Git Ignore Generator - Whitelist
# This file defines patterns that should NOT be ignored by .gitignore
# Add patterns here that you want to keep in your repository despite matching .gitignore rules
# 
# Usage:
#   Add patterns one per line (without leading !)
#   These patterns will be added to .gitignore as !pattern
#   
# Examples:
#   .env.example     # Keep example env files
#   docs/*.md        # Keep documentation
#   config/local.js  # Keep specific config files

# Magic Scripts files that should be tracked
